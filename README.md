## About Bloom

Bloom is a web application built with tailwind CSS framework.Tailwind CSS was my ideal choice due to its easy integration with HTML and lower level syntax.It was built with the idea of trying to approach a more effeminate look in the design. 
For behavioral interaction vanilla Javascript was used.
